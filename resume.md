##Projects
###BrokeFlix -- www.brokeflix.com
BrokeFlix is a single page app built with a detached React frontend and a Rails 5 API only mode backend. the frontend was configured with Webpack and is hosted on Amazon Web Services. BrokeFlix collects all movies that can currently be viewed on free streaming services and attaches their respective Metascore and RottenTomatoes scores for filtering. All filtering you do is applied immediately except in the case of the year range, infinite scroll and manual text search which are debounced to limit the number of unnecessary calls. It collects all of the information by making various calls to TheMovieDatabase and Guidebox API's to collect all movie details, trailers, sources, and cast data. All styling is done using Semantic UI and the site is completely responsive. Brokeflix was a great project to build upon my React skills.
###Action Cable Chat -- actionchattin.herokuapp.com
A basic chat application that gave me a chance to work with one of the main new features in Rails 5. The app uses action cable for the implementation of WebSockets. I used Redis to act as a data store for the action cable channels. All chat is real time and the app also notifies you when users enter or exit a room. To give it a test run just create a user, open two browsers to the open group channel and type a message and see it arrive on both windows. You can also create private rooms and invite anyone that is already on the site to join. I wrote two blog posts at medium.com/@tomyncy618 walking through the development step by step which got quite a few people to sign up and do the walkthrough.
###ConcertBuddy -- concertbuddy.herokuapp.com
Concert Buddy was originally conceived at a Spotify hackathon. The intent of the application is to be the Meetup for concerts. Concert Buddy utilizes the Songkick and Spotify APIs to collect concert and artist information. You can search for concerts by artist, location and desired dates. For each event you can view information about the headlining artist and listen to them via Spotify or buy tickets through Songkick. From there you can create a group or join a pre-existing one. Once you are a member of a group you can message the rest of the groups to plan the event. Concert Buddy was built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and an MVC Javascript front end. Most of the user interface is achieved with AJAX requests, logging in is achieved through Google Oauth2 and all messages are accompanied with email processed through action mailer.
###CitiBike Map -- fast-tor-35920.herokuapp.com
Mobile-first Ruby on Rails web application that tracks the number of available bikes at nearby CitiBike stations. Users can filter stations by number of bikes or location and get GPS directions to the station of their choosing. The application pulls data from the Citi Bike Live Station Feed API. It was built with the Ruby on Rails framework but most of the processing is done on the front end using MVC Javascript.
